## React-Weather-App

### Plan
* CRA, install enzyme, delete unneccessary files from CRA and create a test folder
* Run a simple "render without crashing" test to pass
* Initial commit to Github
* Create basic input component and placeholder image homepage
* Create routes
* Create API calls and results page
* Add tests for image and weather api rendering / no input
* Further styling
* Cleanup and check everything works as intended

### Notes
* Struggled with making form submit redirect to new route with the search data - managed to solve using withRouter history
* Missing "https" infront of weather API string resulted in 404, took about an hour to realise and fix

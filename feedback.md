This is a really good effort, a working app and an obvious effort to test. Well done! 

* Tests should be up one level - on the same one as `/src` and `/public` etc.
* Great job for trying to test all components, pity that the ones for Home component didn't work. 
* both apis work, but they seem a little out of sync
* additionally, the images do not correlate to the location entered - which was the intended functionality
* styling could be a little more creative
